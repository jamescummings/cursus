##The Project:

The purpose of the CURSUS project was to employ XML, together with transformations in XSLT, to make data from sources of medieval Latin liturgy available on the Web. The project is housed at The University of East Anglia, Norwich, and was funded 2000 - 2003 by a major research grant from the Arts and Humanities Research Board of the UK.

##The Website:

This site has two main branches, which may be accessed from the navigation links on the left. The first ('About CURSUS') takes you to pages which explain the nature of the project and of the data it presents, its editorial method, and the technologies we have employed. The other ('Explore CURSUS data') will take you directly to the pages which enable you to access the data.

##Status:

Following the death of the Principle Investigator, Professor David Chadd (University of East Anglia) in November 2006, the project became at risk. Around 2010, UEA stopped providing hosting for the project's website. Since then, Dr James Cummings (the initial research associate on the project) agreed a CC+by+nc licence with them for the
content produced by the project and with the help of @ironchicken (Dr Richard Lewis) makes the available under the same <a
