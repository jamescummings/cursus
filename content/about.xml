<h1>About CURSUS</h1>

<h3>The Project:</h3>
<p>The purpose of the <span class="project_name">CURSUS</span> project is 
to employ the Extensible Markup Language (<span class="acronym">XML</span>), 
together with transformations performed by the Extensible Stylesheet Language 
(<span class="acronym">XSLT</span>), to make data from sources of medieval Latin 
liturgy available on the Web.  The project is housed at <a href="http://www.uea.ac.uk/">
The University of East Anglia, Norwich</a>, and was funded 2000 - 2003 by a 
major research grant from the <a href="http://www.ahrc.ac.uk/">Arts and 
Humanities Research Board of the UK</a>.</p>
<h3>The Website:</h3>
<p>This site has two main branches, which may be accessed from the navigation 
links on the left.  The first ('About <span class="project_name">CURSUS</span>') 
takes you to pages which explain the nature of the project and of the data it 
presents, its editorial method, and the technologies we have employed.  The 
other ('Explore <span class="project_name">CURSUS</span> data') will take you 
directly to the pages which enable you to access the data.</p>
<h3>Staff:</h3>
<p>The project was conceived and lead by David Chadd. During its funded period Dr. James Cummings
acted as research associate and undertook most of the technical aspects of the work as well as some
transcriptions. David continued to work on the transcriptions (and oversaw the implementation of a
full-text search facility for the project by Richard Lewis) after the end of the funded period up
until his death in November 2006.</p>
<h3>Status:</h3>
<p>Around 2010, UEA stopped providing hosting for the project's
website. Since then, James Cummings has acquired the rights to the
content produced by the project and now publishes them on new hosting
under the <a
